*what is time complexity?
-->Time complexity is a type of computational complexity that describes the time required to execute an algorithm.
*why do we ignore constants in time complexity?
-->Constants in big O notations are usually ignored because they don't add much to the complexity when the input size is very large. 
*why we only consider largest number in time complexity in algorithm?
-->It gives an upper bound on the resources required by the algorithm. In the case of running time, the worst-case time complexity indicates the longest running time performed by an algorithm given any input of size n, 
and thus guarantees that the algorithm will finish in the indicated period of time.
